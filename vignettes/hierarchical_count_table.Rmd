This guide provides a detailed overview of the `hierarchical_count_table` module and its features. It is meant to provide guidance to
App Creators on creating Apps in DaVinci using the `hierarchical_count_table` module.
Walk-throughs for sample app creation using the module are also included
to demonstrate the various module specific features.

The `hierarchical_count_table` module makes it possible to visualize a hierarchy table with event counts for each of the levels.

# Features

`hierarchical_count_table` features the following tables:

-   A hierarchy table arranged by highest to lowest event count normalized by population.

It supports bookmarking.

# Arguments for the module

`dv.tables::mod_hierarchical_count_table()`
module uses several arguments with the following being mandatory and
the rest optional. As part of app creation, the app
creator should specify the values for these arguments as applicable.

**Mandatory Arguments**

-   `module_id` : A unique identifier of type character for the module
    in the app.

-   `subjid_var`: A common column across all datasets that uniquely identify subjects. By default: "SUBJID"

-   `table_dataset_name`: The dataset that contains the events per row. For example, `ADAE`

-   `pop_dataset_name`: The dataset that contains one row per subject in the total population. For example, `ADSL`
    It expects a dataset with an structure similar to https://www.cdisc.org/kb/examples/adam-subject-level-analysis-adsl-dataset-80283806 , one record per subject
    It expects to contain, at least, `subjid_var`
    
Refer to `dv.tables::mod_hierarchical_count_table()` for the complete list of arguments and their description.

# Input menus
  
A set of menus allows to select a hierarchy, groupings and settings of the table.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
requireNamespace("pharmaverseadam")

adsl_dataset <- pharmaverseadam::adsl %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    dplyr::across(
      dplyr::where(is.character), as.factor
    )
  )

adae_dataset <- pharmaverseadam::adae %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    dplyr::across(
      dplyr::where(is.character), as.factor
    )
  )

dv.manager::run_app(
  data = list(dummy = list(adsl = adsl_dataset, adbm = adbm_dataset)),
  module_list = list(
    "AE Hierarchy Table" = dv.tables::mod_hierarchical_count_table(
      module_id = "hierarchical_count_table",
      table_dataset_name = "adae",
      pop_dataset_name = "adsl"
    )
  ),
  filter_data = "adsl",
  filter_key = "USUBJID"
)
```

# Drill down functionality

This module shows by default the subject ID of the subjects in a given cell.

It also has the capacity of returning a list with the subjids to other modules. If you have a use case for in which
you would prefer a more complex interaction, for example passing the a given ID to another module (e.g. `dv.papo`)
please let us know or open an issue in the repo!
